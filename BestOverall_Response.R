# IMPORTANT 1! Data used in this example script are fictitious because of registration required by 
# MMRF Researcher Gateway (RG) for accessing data.
# Fictitious data can be loaded by using clinMMGateway <- get(load("clinMMGateway")). 


# IMPORTANT 1! If you want to reproduce the case study 2 by using complete MMRF Researcher Gateway (RG) clinical data, 
#you would need to download data from MMRF Researcher Gateway (RG) and import them into your R environmnet for feeding the following Workflow.
# Before feeding the workflow with downloaded data, you would need to comment <get(load("data/clinMMGateway.rda"))>, replace <listSamples> with
# your list of samples. Once this is done, you would can import downloaded data into R environmnet for using them instead of 
#<clinMMGateway>.


# Note1:at the time of this script, the response-treatment file name to download from MMRF Researcher Gateway (RG) 
# is "MMRF_CoMMpass_IA14_STAND_ALONE_TRTRESP.csv".

#Note2: pay attention to import MMRF-RG dataset into R environment including the heading of columns.
